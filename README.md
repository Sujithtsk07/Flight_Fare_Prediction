Air travel is a common mode of transportation, but fluctuating flight prices can make it challenging for travelers to find the best deals. This project addresses this issue by developing a predictive model that 
forecasts future flight prices based on historical data. By utilizing machine learning algorithms, the model analyzes various factors such as departure date, destination, airline, and route to generate accurate 
price predictions.

Features

- Flight Price Prediction: Predict future flight prices with high accuracy using historical data and machine learning techniques.
- User-Friendly Interface: Provide a simple and intuitive interface for users to input their travel details and receive price estimates.
- Customizable Options: Allow users to adjust parameters such as departure date, destination, and airline to tailor predictions to their specific needs.
- Real-Time Updates: Incorporate real-time data feeds to continuously update price predictions and reflect changes in market conditions.
- Performance Metrics: Evaluate model performance using metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) to ensure accuracy and reliability.
